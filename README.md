# supply-chain-optimization
## Objective
Track inventory levels, order fulfillment, delivery timelines, and logistics costs to streamline supply chain operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Data Sources
Integrate data from various systems for comprehensive analysis:
- ERP Systems: Track inventory, procurement, and sales data.
- Supply Chain Management Software: Monitor order processing and vendor management.
- GPS Tracking Systems: Record delivery timelines and route efficiency.
  
### 2. Metrics
Define critical metrics to measure and optimize supply chain performance:
- Inventory Turnover: Frequency of inventory replacement over a period.
- Order Delivery Time: Average time taken from order placement to delivery.
- Transportation Cost per Unit: Logistics cost per item shipped.
- Supplier Performance: Evaluate suppliers based on delivery accuracy, quality, and cost efficiency.
  
### 3. Power BI Features Utilized
Leverage Power BIâ€™s features for actionable insights and effective decision-making:
#### 1. Inventory Dashboards:
 - Line and Area Charts: Display stock levels, reorder points, and sales forecasts over time.
 - KPI Indicators: Track key inventory metrics such as turnover rates and stockouts.
#### 2. Logistics Performance Monitoring:
 - Interactive Maps: Visualize delivery routes, transit delays, and regional delivery trends.
 - Gantt Charts: Monitor delivery schedules and identify bottlenecks in transit.
#### 3. Supplier Analysis:
 - Bar Charts: Compare supplier performance by metrics such as delivery accuracy and costs.
 - Scatter Plots: Correlate supplier performance metrics to identify trends and anomalies.

## Actionable Insights
With Power BI dashboards, supply chain managers can:
#### 1. Streamline Inventory Management:
 - Maintain optimal stock levels to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
 - Identify trends in sales to adjust inventory forecasts.
#### 2. Optimize Logistics and Delivery:
 - Reduce delays by identifying and improving inefficient routes or transit processes.
 - Monitor delivery timelines and address recurring delays.
#### 3. Enhance Supplier Relationships:
 - Reward high-performing suppliers and renegotiate contracts with underperforming ones.
 - Identify cost-saving opportunities with suppliers based on performance metrics.
#### 4. Control Operational Costs:
 - Minimize transportation costs by analyzing route and carrier efficiency.
- Adjust logistics strategies based on cost per unit and delivery trends.
